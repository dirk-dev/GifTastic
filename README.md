# GifTastic

**GiTastic** uses the Giphy API to download & display 10 gifs that correspond to the button the user selects. 

It also allows the user to select gifs, and the app then adds a new button to the screen corresponding to the user's selection.

The images are initially displayed as static images rather than gifs. When the user clicks on the image, it will switch to the animated gif, and swith back when the image is clicked again.

This project was a class exercise in JavaScript, jQuery, APIs, CSS, and HTML.

**GiTastic** was coded by me, and is maintained by me.
